DEFINITION
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,encapsulates each
one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary
independently from clients that use it. 

PROBLEMS SOLVED
-A sub class or child class inheriting a mthd it doesn't use.
-Code duplication
-High coupling
-low cohesion
-unmaintainable code

GOALS OF SP
-Define family of algorithms
-Encapsulate each family
-Make the interchangeable
-Make the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

PRINCIPLES APPLIED
-Solid
-Polymorphism
-Composition
-Abstraction
